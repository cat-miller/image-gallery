# Image Upload

This project is all about image upload with cloudinary.

The user can drag his image onto the react-dropzone element, tag it with comma separated tags and upload it.
Once uploaded, it is stored in cloudinary. All uploaded images are displayed in a gallery. A Set of tags appear in the sidebar. Clicking on one will filter the gallery for all images with that tag.
